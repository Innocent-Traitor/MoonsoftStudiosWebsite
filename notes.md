Right Side, Languages, Software, and Tools I use

I am a hobbyist developer, focused on making games that I would enjoy playing and developing tools I would use myself. I've been working on various different projects for a few years now, and always have tons of ideas for new ones! I also dabble in content creation showing off my creations or those I've worked on with others. I always enjoy learning new things, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills. I hope I can one day develop Moonsoft Studios into a successful game studio!
